This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The Twooter WebApp provides a place for anyone to share whats on their mind. Log in or sign up to start twooting and interacting with 
others twoots. User data is saved securely on a cloud database and password data is hashed.

The webapp is split into Client and Server which can be run/deployed completely seperately in order to split up 
the load and seperate important data and functions for security. 

If you are in the client or server directory you can run 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' in order to start the client.


Notable Packages: React, JWT, Redux, Axios, Bcrypt, Body-Parser, Cors, Express, Mongoose, Nodemon

Further information available in package.json
